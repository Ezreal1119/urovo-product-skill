## Payment Certifications

Product specifications list the following baseline certification families:
- PCI PTS 6.x security certification
- EMV Level 1 & Level 2
- EMV Contactless Level 1
- PayWave, PayPass, American Express Expresspay

Actual certification validity is configuration-, project-, firmware-, and date-specific. Use [[shared/pos-certificates|POS Certificates and Firmware Validity]] for exact status, certificate/report numbers, approval and expiry dates, and PCI firmware renewal dates. Use [[shared/pos-financial-certification-kernel-versions|POS Financial Certification Kernel Versions]] for exact ICCR/PCD and payment-kernel version strings. Never apply one project's status or kernel version to another configuration.
